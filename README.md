# Floating Memories

An interactive 3D photo gallery built with Three.js and React Three Fiber.

Photos float in space with subtle motion.  
Users can hover, click, and flip cards to explore memories in a zero-gravity environment.

This project focuses on learning core 3D concepts while building a visually polished result.
